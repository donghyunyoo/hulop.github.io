# Instructions for NavCog Preview

In this page you can find the description of the NavCog Preview application, including all the commands and Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ).

## NavCog Preview description
NavCog Preview enables users to simulate routes on the first floor of the DoubleTree Hotel by Hilton. This application intends to increase the knowledge about a particular area before visiting it in person.
After selecting a starting point and a destination, NavCog Preview provides turn-by-turn instructions to reach the destination, as well as information about important landmarks and Points of Interest that can be found on the way.

Users will be able to simulate routes at the DoubleTree Hotel in order to familiarize with the environment, before visiting it during the conference. Some route examples can include "From the Main Entrance to the Conference Registration Desk" or "From the Elevator to the Monongahela Room".

## NavCog Preview Interface and Commands
Here we describe the different gestures and commands that can be used to interact with NavCog Preview.
At the main screen, users are able to change the current settings or search for a route. After selecting search, users are able to select the Starting Point (From) and the Destination (To), and select "Preview" to start the navigation. Users can also change the area at any point.

Ater starting the navigation the system will provide you the instructions you need to follow. The main commands you can use to simulate navigation are swiping (up, down, left and right), and rotating the phone.
More information about each command is presented below:

### Swipe-Up - Move (or Jump) to the next intersection or point-of-interest
A Swipe-Up moves the user to the next intersection, point-of-interest or landmark, whichever comes first. After swiping, you can hear a quick-sound of steps to indicate movement, the distance travelled (for instance "30 feet walked") and the next instruction (for instance, "turn right").

### Swipe-Down - Move (or Jump) to the previous intersection or point-of-interest
A Swipe-Down moves the user to the previous intersection, point-of-interest or landmark, whichever comes first. After swiping, you can hear a quick-sound of steps to indicate movement, the distance travelled (for instance "30 feet walked back") and the next instruction (for instance, "proceed 10 feet and turn right").

### Two-Finger Swipe-Up - Start walking at a fixed speed
A Two-Finger Swipe-Up initiates walking at a fixed speed. The user can hear the steps, indicating one step forward, and is informed about the landmarks he is passing by (for example "a column is on your right") and the required instructions (for example "proceed 20 meters" or "turn left").
If already walking, another Two-Finger Swipe-Up increases the speed, while a Two-Finger Swipe-Down reduces the speed.
A single tap on the screen stops the walking.

### Two-Finger Swipe-Down - Reduce walking speed
In case the user initiates automatic walking, a Two-Finger Swipe-Down reduces the walking speed. 

### Three-Finger Swipe-Up - Move or (jump) to the next intersection
Similar to the regular Swipe-Up, but does not consider landmarks and points-of-interest. It moves the user immediately to the next intersection without stopping at the other points of interest.
After swiping, you may hear a quick-sound of steps to indicate movement, the distance travelled (for instance "30 feet walked") and the next instruction (for instance, "turn right").

### Three-Finger Swipe-Down - Move or (jump) to the previous intersection
Similar to the Three-Finger Swipe-Up, but moves the user to the previous intersection. It also does not consider landmarks or points of interest.

### Swipe-Left and Swipe-Right - Turn left and Turn right
When the user needs to make a turn in order to continue on the route, the smartphone vibrates and the system announces that a turn is required (for example "turn right" or "slight right"). In order to turn, the user can make swipe in the direction of the required turn (left or right). A confirmation sound is provided if the turn is succeeded. 

### Rotate the smartphone left or right - Turn left and Turn right
Another way to make a turn is to rotate the phone as if actually turning to the required direction. A confirmation sound is also provided when the turn is completed. The user is then able to return the phone to its original orientation, or keep it with the same orientation after the turn.

### Tap the phone - Stop walking
In case the walking is activated (with the Two-Finger Swipe-Up), a single tap on the phone will stop the automatic walking.

### Three-Finger Tap
A tap on the screen with three fingers repeats the last instruction.

### Four-Finger Tap
A tap with four fingers on the lower part of the screen restarts the navigation at the starting point.

### Shake the Smartphone - Quit the current route
In order to quit the current route, the user may select the button on the top-right of the screen. However, another option is to shake the smartphone.

## NavCog Preview Settings
We advise you to maintain the settings as they are by default.
However, in case you feel more comfortable with meters as distance unit, instead of feet, please change it in the settings.

In case you don't like to listen to the step sound when walking or moving/jumping between POIs and turning points, you can disable it.

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)
### I can't hear the sound of steps when moving forward. What should I do?
Please check if the ringer volume is not in silent mode or very low. In case it is, please increase the volume.
If you still do not hear the sound of steps, check the options "Step sound for jump" and "Step sound for walk". Both of these options should be On.

### When I swipe up, the control center appears. What should I do to avoid this.
When this happens, please try to perform the swipe-up gestures on the center of the screen instead of the bottom of the screen. This is a know issue that we are currently working on fixing.

### Some error occurred and I do not know what to do.
Quit the application in the app switcher, and restart it.
